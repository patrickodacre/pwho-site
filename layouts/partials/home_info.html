    	<p>
  		I am a software engineer turned Indie Hacker & Entrepreneur. I have worked with numerous early-stage startups, and the last several years has led me to building my own from scratch.
    	</p>

		<p>I value curiosity, clear thinking, and a solution only as complex as the problem demands.</p>
