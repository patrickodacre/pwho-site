Hackers&amp;rsquo; Workshop gives you simple tooling to manage a development team or program a full application yourself.
You own everything &amp;ndash; All the code. All the infrastructure.
No lock in.
It&amp;rsquo;s all yours.
Your Hacker Workshop offers the tooling and guidance you need to manage the complexities of developing an application, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent you from getting into the weeds if you want.</description>

      <description>Handmade Games is a passion project where I share my experiences learning how to program games from scratch using the Odin programming language.
Programming games is fun and educational. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started, and the skills you develop while programming games will make you a better programmer no matter your professional focus.
Space Shooter is the first game I started to share on YouTube, and the response has been better than I expected.</description>
