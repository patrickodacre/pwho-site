Handmade Games is a passion project where I share my experiences learning how to program games from scratch using the Odin programming language.

Programming games is fun and educational. It's easy to get started, and the skills you develop while programming games will make you a better programmer no matter your professional focus.

[Space Shooter](https://github.com/patrickodacre/odin-space-shooter) is the first game I started to share on YouTube, and the response has been better than I expected.

Shortly after beginning the series, I was asked to do an [interview](https://odin-lang.org/news/newsletter-2023-04/) for the Odin newsletter.

Overall, I've been enjoying myself, and I'm pleased to see the Odin community grow.
